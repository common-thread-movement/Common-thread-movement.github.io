    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>The Common Thread is a civic-national movement dedicated to restoring the moral and civic foundations that make a nation capable of unity, responsibility, and shared destiny.</p>

    <p>We believe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Majority and minority status are fluid, not tribal.</li>
        <li>Civic duty is superior to factional loyalty.</li>
        <li>Integrity is the social glue that holds a nation together.</li>
        <li>Unity must be chosen freely through moral courage.</li>
        <li>A nation is healthier when citizens serve the common good even at personal cost.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our goal is to reweave America’s moral fabric through service, community repair, and a renewed commitment to truth, conscience, and responsibility.</p>
