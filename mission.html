    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
        The mission of the Common Thread Civic Movement is to rebuild America's moral 
        and civic foundations by strengthening conscience, responsibility, unity, 
        and voluntary moral commitment. We reject tribalism and the idea that 
        political identity defines a person's entire moral world.
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe that a healthy nation depends on the character of its people — 
        their honesty, courage, humility, compassion, and willingness to serve. 
        Civic unity is only possible when citizens choose moral duty over dominance, 
        truth over convenience, and integrity over tribal loyalty.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to revive the moral rhythm that once defined American civic life, 
        restoring a culture where responsibility is shared, communities lift one another, 
        and citizenship is rooted in conscience rather than faction.
