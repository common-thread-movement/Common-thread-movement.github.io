<h1>Live It Today</h1>

<p>
You do not join the Common Thread — you live it.  
There is no membership, no status, and no enrollment.  
If the posture resonates with you, you may begin living it now, quietly and personally.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. A Call to Civic Maturity</h2>
<p>
You are responsible for the condition of your life and the condition of your community.  
No one can live this posture for you.  
You may begin today with small, grounded acts of responsibility, dignity, and honesty.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Begin With Personal Action</h2>
<p>Start by choosing one small action that strengthens your conscience and your civic maturity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tell the truth where it costs you something.</li>
    <li>Take responsibility for a task you’ve been avoiding.</li>
    <li>Repair one small thing you contributed to breaking.</li>
    <li>Extend dignity to someone who is not expecting it.</li>
    <li>Improve one neglected thing in your immediate environment.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3. Reflection</h2>
<p>
Reflection is part of civic maturity.  
You may use the prompts below to think through your own conscience and choices.
</p>

<h3>Civic Maturity Prompts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What responsibility can I take today that I’ve avoided?</li>
    <li>Where can I act with dignity where it’s difficult?</li>
    <li>What small step would improve my community right now?</li>
</ul>

<form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST">
    <label>Your Reflection</label>
    <textarea name="reflection" placeholder="Type your reflection here..."></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Submit Reflection</button>
</form>

<p style="font-size: 14px; opacity: 0.7;">
    Submitting a reflection does not join you to anything.  
    Submissions may be responded to privately or may be chosen (anonymously) for the Questions page.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Optional: A Civic Walk</h2>
<p>
If you want a grounded way to begin living the posture today, take a short walk where you live.  
Look at your surroundings with clear eyes.
</p>

<p>Notice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is neglected?</li>
    <li>What small thing could be improved?</li>
    <li>Who around you may need steadiness?</li>
</ul>

<p>
A Civic Walk does not require action — only awareness.  
Awareness leads naturally to responsibility.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Continue Quietly</h2>
<p>
Living the Common Thread is private, inward, and independent.  
If you live with dignity, honesty, grounded awareness, responsibility, and accountability,  
you are already walking the posture.
