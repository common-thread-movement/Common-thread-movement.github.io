    <h1>About the Common Thread Movement</h1>

    <p>
        The Common Thread Movement was created to give people a place to belong —
        not through ideology, ancestry, religion, or political tribe, but through a shared
        commitment to something deeper and more durable:
        <strong>civic maturity, responsibility, integrity, and the quiet dignity of doing what is right.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        This movement is intentionally non-partisan and non-sectarian. It is not a religious group,
        not a political faction, and not a hierarchical organization. It is a community identity
        that individuals may choose to embody in their daily lives. No one can grant it or revoke it.
        It is lived, not assigned.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Exists</h2>

    <p>
        Modern public life is increasingly shaped by tribalism, inherited narratives, and group
        identities that divide people into categories they never chose. The Common Thread offers
        an alternative path: a civic identity rooted in
        <strong>character, accountability, personal responsibility, and the recognition of a shared future.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of defining people by race, class, party, or grievance, this movement asks one
        question: <strong>What are you building?</strong><br>
        What are you contributing to the community you live in — today, right now, in small and
        meaningful ways?
    </p>

    <h2>What It Stands For</h2>

    <p>The Common Thread Movement emphasizes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal responsibility</strong> — Owning your actions and their impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability</strong> — Being someone others can trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Civic maturity</strong> — Seeing beyond tribal labels.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — Doing the right thing when no one is watching.</li>
        <li><strong>Community over category</strong> — Serving real people, not abstract groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Not a Club — A Character</h2>

    <p>
        The Common Thread is not an organization with membership rolls, leadership titles, or
        official positions. It is a <strong>character identity</strong> recognized in someone who:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>acts with maturity,</li>
        <li>speaks with honesty,</li>
        <li>seeks truth rather than advantage,</li>
        <li>and contributes positively to the community around them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Anyone can embody this identity.<br>
        No one can grant it.<br>
        No one can take it away.<br>
        It is a choice, lived daily.
    </p>
