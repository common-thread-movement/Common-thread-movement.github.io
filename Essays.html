    <h2>Foundational Essays</h2>

    <p>The Common Thread movement is built on a series of civic writings that explore unity, moral responsibility, and the future of American civic nationalism. This page will host our foundational documents.</p>

    <h3>1. Bless G-d, Bless America, Bless Wherever You're From</h3>
    <p>A long-form civic essay exploring integrity, duty, moral rhythm, and the only sustainable path forward for a divided nation.</p>

    <h3>2. The Moral Constitution</h3>
    <p>An expanded framework outlining the principles of conscience, unity, and civic duty that anchor the Common Thread movement.</p>

    <h3>3. The Duty of the Citizen</h3>
    <p>A direct explanation of the responsibilities that strengthen a nation from the inside, beyond tribe or partisan identity.</p>

    <p>More essays will be added as the movement grows.</p>
