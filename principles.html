    <h1>Core Principles</h1>

    <p>
        The Common Thread Civic Movement is guided by a set of core principles designed 
        to strengthen the moral, civic, and communal foundations of American life. 
        These principles form a framework for unity, responsibility, and moral clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Conscience Above Tribe</h2>
    <p>
        Loyalty to political groups, demographics, or tribal identities must never override 
        personal moral responsibility. Conscience comes before alignment.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Duty Over Dominance</h2>
    <p>
        A healthy society is built not on power-seeking, but on service, sacrifice, and 
        contributing to the shared good.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Integrity as the Foundation of Trust</h2>
    <p>
        Institutions and communities can only function when both citizens and leaders uphold 
        honesty, transparency, and moral consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Unity as a Voluntary Moral Choice</h2>
    <p>
        True unity cannot be forced. It emerges when individuals choose cooperation, shared 
        values, and mutual respect.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Responsibility as a Civic Virtue</h2>
    <p>
        Every citizen plays a part in sustaining the moral and civic health of the nation. 
        Responsibility is the core of citizenship.
