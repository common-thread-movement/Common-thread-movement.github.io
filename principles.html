    <h2>The Civic Code</h2>

    <p>The following principles form the moral and civic foundation of the Common Thread movement. They are not laws—they are commitments that strengthen the nation from the inside out.</p>

    <h3>1. Merit Over Tribe</h3>
    <p>Identity earns no virtue; actions do. A nation thrives when people rise by character, not category.</p>

    <h3>2. Duty Before Dominance</h3>
    <p>Power pursued for its own sake devours the nation that grants it. Duty protects what dominance destroys.</p>

    <h3>3. Integrity as Social Glue</h3>
    <p>When honesty collapses, institutions hollow out from the inside. Shared truth is the basis of shared trust.</p>

    <h3>4. A Nation Is a Moral Field</h3>
    <p>Everything citizens do adds or subtracts from the nation’s moral space. We are responsible for what we shape.</p>

    <h3>5. Shared Responsibility, Shared Reward</h3>
    <p>A nation is a cooperative project, not a competition of factions.</p>

    <h3>6. Unity Through Voluntary Commitment</h3>
    <p>Real unity is chosen through conscience, not coerced through force.</p>

    <h3>7. Majority/Minority Fluidity</h3>
    <p>No group holds the majority forever. Humility is national survival.</p>

    <h3>8. Citizenship Is an Active Verb</h3>
    <p>A democracy survives only when citizens participate with seriousness, courage, and duty.</p>

    <h3>9. Truth Over Partisanship</h3>
    <p>Parties are temporary. The nation is permanent.</p>

    <h3>10. Human Dignity Is Non-Negotiable</h3>
    <p>Rights do not come from government; government exists to guard them.</p>

    <h3>11. Moral Courage Over Social Comfort</h3>
    <p>Going beyond tribe requires bravery. Conscience is higher than conformity.</p>

    <h3>12. The Common Thread</h3>
    <p>A nation succeeds only when its people see themselves as part of one shared story.</p>
