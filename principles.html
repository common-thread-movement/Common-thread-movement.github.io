    <h2>Core Principles</h2>

    <p>
        The Common Thread Civic Movement is guided by a set of core principles designed 
        to strengthen the moral, civic, and communal foundations of American life. 
        These principles form a framework for unity, responsibility, and moral clarity.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Conscience Above Tribe</h3>
    <p>
        We reject the idea that loyalty to a political group, demographic, or tribe 
        should override moral responsibility. Conscience must come first.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Duty Over Dominance</h3>
    <p>
        A healthy society is not built on the pursuit of power, but on service, sacrifice, 
        and the willingness to contribute to the common good.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Integrity as the Foundation of Trust</h3>
    <p>
        Institutions can only function when citizens and leaders demonstrate honesty, 
        transparency, and moral consistency.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Unity as a Voluntary Moral Choice</h3>
    <p>
        True unity cannot be forced. It arises when individuals freely choose 
        cooperation, shared values, and respect for one another.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Responsibility as a Civic Virtue</h3>
    <p>
        Every citizen has a role in maintaining the moral and civic health of the nation. 
        Responsibility is the core of citizenship.
