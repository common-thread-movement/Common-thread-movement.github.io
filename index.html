    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
        The Common Thread is a civic-national movement focused on unity, responsibility,
        integrity, and the rebuilding of America’s moral foundation. We believe that the 
        strength of a nation comes from the character of its citizens and their willingness 
        to choose duty over dominance, conscience over tribe, and unity over division.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here you’ll find the core mission, principles, and essays that guide this movement. 
        We invite you to read, think, and take part in restoring the shared moral rhythm 
        that holds a nation together.
