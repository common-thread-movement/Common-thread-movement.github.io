        New to the Common Thread Movement? You can begin immediately through action,
        or take time to read the full overview. Both paths are valid.
    </p>

    <h2>Option 1: Do One Quiet Act (Recommended)</h2>

    <p>
        Choose one small repair that improves the environment around you — and do it quietly.
        This is the core civic practice.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pick up <strong>10 pieces of trash</strong> on a block that isn’t yours</li>
        <li>Return <strong>3 stray carts</strong></li>
        <li>Wipe down a public surface (cart handle, pump area, table)</li>
        <li>Help one person with something small (directions, carrying, patience)</li>
        <li>Fix one small thing you normally ignore</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Record it privately using the Field Kit.

    <h2>Option 2: Read the Overview</h2>

    <p>
        If you prefer to understand the philosophy, structure, and civic intent first,
        begin with the Start Here overview.

<!-- WHAT THIS IS -->
<section class="content-box" id="about-core">

    <h2>What This Is</h2>

    <p>
        The Common Thread is a civic identity meant for the real world — a world where people are busy,
        stressed, divided, and pulled in different directions. It does not assume harmony, and it does
        not pretend society is simpler than it is. Instead, it offers a clear, steady posture anyone can
        choose: responsibility over avoidance, honesty over convenience, and dignity over hostility.
    </p>

    <p>
        This identity is voluntary, non-partisan, and grounded. It does not require joining anything,
        believing anything, or belonging to a group. It recognizes that public life can be chaotic and
        polarized, and that the most stabilizing force in a community is the individual citizen who
        acts with clarity, restraint, and conscience, especially when it is difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Common Thread does not promise to fix society. It focuses on something smaller and more
        realistic: helping individuals strengthen their own civic posture so they can be a positive,
        stabilizing presence in the environments they actually live in — homes, workplaces,
        neighborhoods, and daily interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Explore our essays, charter, mission, and principles to understand how this civic posture works
        in practice and how it can be lived today without money, organization, or ideology — just
        character.

<!-- CIVIC PLEDGE -->
<section class="content-box" id="pledge">

    <h2>A Civic Pledge for the Republic</h2>

    <p>
        First, we acknowledge ourselves as human beings, equal by nature, bearers of inherent dignity,
        and responsible for the justice we extend to one another.
    </p>

    <p>
        Second, we stand as citizens, stewards of ordered liberty, guardians of peace within our
        communities, and participants in the common good of the Republic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Third, we labor as co-workers, valuing honest industry, fair dealing, and the workmanship
        that upholds a strong and self-reliant nation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fourth, we conduct ourselves as friends, choosing loyalty without corruption, candor without
        cruelty, and unity without surrendering our conscience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fifth, we remain bound as family, honoring our forebears, strengthening the household, and
        preserving a moral inheritance for generations to come.
    </p>

    <p>
        And in all these roles, we uphold these civic principles: to seek truth, to practice restraint,
        to respect lawful authority, to defend the innocent, to reject factionalism, and to advance
        the welfare of the country above personal grievance. Thus we pledge ourselves to the continuance
        of the Republic, that the freedoms entrusted to us may be preserved for all.
    </p>
