    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
        The Common Thread is a civic-national movement built around unity, conscience, 
        responsibility, and integrity. We believe the strength of a nation depends not only 
        on its laws and institutions, but on the character of its citizens and their willingness 
        to choose duty over dominance, truth over convenience, and conscience over tribalism.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our essays, mission, and principles outline a new vision for American civic life — one 
        rooted in voluntary unity, moral rhythm, shared responsibility, and the courage to stand 
        beyond partisan identities. Explore our work using the navigation bar above.
