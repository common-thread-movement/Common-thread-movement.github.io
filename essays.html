    <h2>Foundational Essays</h2>

    <p>
        These essays form the moral, civic, and philosophical backbone of the Common Thread movement. 
        Each one explores a different angle of unity, duty, integrity, and what it means to rebuild a 
        nation from the inside out.

    <h3>1. Bless G-d, Bless America, Bless Wherever You're From</h3>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Integrity as the moral rhythm of a nation.</p>
    <p>
        This essay follows the idea that when a nation’s moral rhythm breaks, everyone feels it—even 
        people who don’t have language for it. It traces how integrity becomes a kind of invisible 
        pressure in public life: when it’s present, people can trust institutions and each other; 
        when it’s gone, everything starts to wobble. The piece argues that tribal power, partisan 
        victory, and identity politics cannot replace simple personal honesty. The way forward is 
        citizens choosing conscience even when it costs them status, comfort, or dominance.

    <h3>2. The Moral Constitution</h3>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> A nation needs a moral structure deeper than its legal one.</p>
    <p>
        Laws sit on top of deeper assumptions: that truth matters, that people have dignity, that 
        promises mean something, that power should answer to something higher than itself. 
        This essay lays out a “moral constitution” beneath the written one—a set of unwritten 
        commitments that allow the written Constitution to function. When those unwritten commitments 
        die, no amount of legal cleverness can save the system. The text argues that the real political 
        crisis is not left vs. right, but shared moral collapse.

    <h3>3. The Duty of the Citizen</h3>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Citizenship is an action, not a label.</p>
    <p>
        In a civic nation, you don’t just “have” citizenship—you practice it. This essay describes 
        the duties that keep a free country alive: telling the truth, showing up, voting with 
        seriousness, serving where you can, mentoring those who come after you, and refusing to let 
        power or resentment be your main motivation. It explores how majority and minority status are 
        always shifting, and why clinging to dominance ends up weakening everyone, including the 
        group that “wins.”

    <h3>4. The Collapse of Tribe and the Rise of Conscience</h3>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Tribe feels safe; conscience actually saves.</p>
    <p>
        Tribal identity—political, cultural, racial, ideological—offers a kind of emotional shelter. 
        But that shelter comes with a cost: you inherit enemies you never chose and loyalties you never 
        examined. This essay argues that a healthy civic nation asks people to do something harder: 
        step beyond tribe and act from conscience, even when your “side” boos you for it. 
        It paints the figure of the citizen who is rooted in principles instead of partisan uniforms, 
        and how those people become the real guardians of the common good.

    <h3>5. What Breaks the Thread?</h3>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> How nations quietly unravel from the inside.</p>
    <p>
        This essay looks at the slow ways a society comes apart: small lies, casual corruption, 
        learned helplessness, and the normalization of distrust. It contrasts “shared struggle,” 
        which forges solidarity, with “shared cynicism,” which corrodes it. 
        The “thread” in Common Thread is the lived sense that we are part of one story; 
        this essay maps the forces that cut that thread, and what it takes to start weaving it back.
