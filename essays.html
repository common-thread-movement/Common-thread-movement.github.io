    <h2>Foundational Essays</h2>

    <p>
        These essays form the philosophical and moral backbone of the Common Thread movement. 
        Each piece explores a key idea: unity, conscience, responsibility, identity, and 
        how citizens can rebuild a healthy civic culture in an age of division.
    </p>

    <h3>Bless G-d, Bless America, Bless Wherever You're From</h3>
    <p>
        A reflection on how identity, gratitude, and moral responsibility create a shared 
        civic foundation stronger than faction or tribe. True unity requires recognizing 
        the dignity of every person and acting from conscience rather than dominance.
    </p>

    <h3>The Moral Constitution</h3>
    <p>
        This essay argues that a nation survives not only through its legal constitution, 
        but through an unwritten moral one — the shared virtues, responsibilities, and 
        expectations that make civic life possible.
    </p>

    <h3>The Duty of the Citizen</h3>
    <p>
        Citizenship is not passive. It demands service, integrity, courage, and the capacity 
        to act beyond self-interest for the sake of the community and nation.
    </p>

    <h3>When Tribe Breaks the Thread</h3>
    <p>
        Tribalism creates the illusion of strength but ultimately fractures society. 
        Moral identity — chosen, not inherited — is what holds a nation together. 
        This essay explores how conscience liberates citizens from destructive factionalism.
    </p>

    <h3>Rebuilding the Moral Rhythm</h3>
    <p>
        Societies fall apart when their shared moral rhythm collapses. This essay explains 
        how integrity, duty, and civic responsibility restore the “pulse” that allows 
        communities and nations to function.
